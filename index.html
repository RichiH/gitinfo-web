<h1>#git bot interface</h1>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Here are your choices so far:

<ul>
	<li><a href="faq.php">List FAQ entries</a>
	<li><a href="trigger.php">List active triggers</a> (those things that
	look like !<em>foo</em>)
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following features are available on IRC:
<ul>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong>: inline commands in the form of !<em>foo</em>
(<a href="trigger.php">list</a>) spit out a previously defined text for
<em>foo</em>. It will be addressed to whoever you addressed with the line that
you used the trigger in. It can be used anywhere in the middle of a line,
though it should not run into other words.
	<ul><li><strong>Edit</strong>: If you are logged into NickServ, you
	can use ".trigger_edit &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;new expansion&gt;" to
	change the value of a trigger (no "!" there).
	<li><strong>Add new</strong>: Only available to selected people; same
	syntax as for editing. If you have been hanging out in #git for quite
	some time and haven't been selected yet, go shout at jast to make it
	happen.
	<li><strong>Aliases</strong>: to make one trigger an alias for
	another, set its contents to "@!othertrigger".
	<li><strong>Matching</strong>: if a request for !foo doesn't find an
	expansion named "foo", it will search for other names that
	<em>contain</em> "foo", and will spit out the shortest match instead.
	</ul>
<li><strong>Manpages</strong>: Say something like "man git-commit" to show a
link to one of git's manpages. Addressing works the same as for triggers.
<li><strong>FAQs</strong>: Say something like "faq non-bare" to link to an FAQ
from the git wiki. Valid keywords are the anchors used on the wiki page.
Addressing works the same as for triggers.
<li><strong>Web login</strong>: use the ".weblogin" command to get a link for
activating extra features on the web page, such as editing and reverting
trigger texts.
<li><strong>Random stuff</strong>: use the ".random" command to get a random
line of wisdom (well, a random line of text, at any rate) contributed by a
user.
	<ul><li><strong>Add</strong>: you can contribute lines if you are
	logged in. Simply use the command ".random add <em>Your line
	here</em>".
	<li><strong>Delete</strong>: the bot appends a line's ID when
	outputting the line. You can use the command ".random delete 5" to
	delete the line with ID 5. Note that only a select few can delete
	lines.
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Commands and triggers can be used both in-channel and privately (by using
/msg); if you address a trigger message to someone, the response will be sent
in-channel. Otherwise, private messages will be responded to via NOTICE to you
personally.
